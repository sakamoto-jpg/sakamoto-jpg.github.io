                        </h1>
							<b> Getting started </b>
							<p>The first project given to us in the course was the creation of a website. Having no experience with HTML it seemed like a daunting task. But the rescources given to us made this project a lot easier than it seemed at first and more time consuming than hard. The goal of the website was to keep track of the assignments in this course and you can see the rest of them as they roll in under the VÉL608G tab.</p>

                            <b> Software used </b>
							<p>Never having worked with HTML before I started by looking through the material provided by the teacher and downloading a telmplate from <a href="https://html5up.net">HTLM5up</a> with the template i used being called "Hyperspace" because I liked the aethetic of it, although if I were to make another one or continue development on my website I´d definately chose another template since it turns out it was a little hard to navigate.
                            
                            To edit the source code <a href="https://brackets.io">Brackets</a>, a source code editor, was used. A free and open-source application created by Adobe systems

							<p>To upload my website <a href="https://github.com">Git</a> was used, a version-control system used to track changes in the code during development for any kind of software. Git was used to put in changes to my website repository Github.com. The no cost and and ease of management made Git a prime choice in hosting my website. Lastly to upload my files to github, <a href="https://desktop.github.com">github desktop</a> was used. After running into numerous issues tying with other methods github besttop made it really easy to upload my website.

							<p>After downloading and setting up Bracets and Git a repository was made the template files were uploaded to Brackets. All the files elements, generic and index.html files were accessible and I could start work on the website.

                            The live editor provided by Brackets allowed me to view the changes being made to the wesite as they went. (clicking the lightning icon in the upper right corner). This work was mostly trial and error and coyping and pasting assets from the original file itself.

                            <p>
                                HTML work turned out to be alot easier than originally thought, as it was kind of similar to working in latex. Where files were just copy pasted and trial and error was mostly used. Main challenge came in trying to figure out how to link websites and tabs to buttons and different functions as well as the navigation side of it, as i had to add a tab or a page where all my assignments would be displayed, I copied an asset template and added a button to the top bar to get a new page for the assignments, again mostly trial and error. Other than that the uploading of the website turned out to be the most challenging.

							<p>Happy with the final result, the working files along with the assets and image folders were copied to the GitHub desktop folder connected to the project created on the GitHub website. (To connect to the reopsitory the current repository button in the upper left was cliced and the correct repository was downloaded.)
                                
                                
                            With the click of the connect to main and publish button the website was successfully uploaded.
                                

                            The final change made was to the repository name to the exact link my website was acsessible through.
