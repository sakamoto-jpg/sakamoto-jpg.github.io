							<b> Part 1: the vinyl cutter.</b>
							<p>Simple project simple design with the goal of teching us how to get used to working with a vinyl cutter.
                        Looking for something quick and simple I went on google to find a nice patterrn to cut out.</p>

                            The image was copied over to Inkscape and the bitmap was traced to get an outline of the pattern that the vinyl cutter would use.

                            <p>After getting the bitmap. The Orignal image was deleted. Fill was removed and line thicknes was set to 0.02mm before the file was exported as a .pdf and loaded onto the vinyl cutter in the workshop in VR-III. Unfamiliar with the vinylcutter used much help was received from the course teacher to get the printer to the right settings.

                            <b> Part 2: The lazer cutter.</b>
							<p>For my lazer cutter/ pressfit projet i decided to do a model of one of my favorite WWII airplanes, the P-51 Mustang
                                
                              <span class="image fit"><img src="images/mustang.png" alt="" /></span>
                        The project discription called for a parametric design that could be used and scaled for different materials.
 </p>
							<p>Getting started designing the P-51 and its platform i used a reference picture of the P-51 and used "insert->canvas" to get a reference of the plane I could use to more easily copy the shape of the plane and its wings
                                .</p>
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/iu-15.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
                             <span class="image fit"><img src="images/refs.png" alt="" /></span>
                            
                           <p> I continued like this, designing the wing and the base. Setting up parameters for the base and the material on the way. The parameters were set so that the width of the wings could be changed so that more layers and a thicker plane could be made, also the thickness could be edited with a parameter in case a different thickness material is being used.
                            </p>

					<b>Part 2.5: kerf</b>
							<p> What for? </p>
                            <p>Before cutting out the model it was required for us to perform a kerf test. A test that lets us estimate the width of the lazer to compensate for the distance that will form between the cut parts.</p>
                            <p>So a rectangle was drawn and cut up 10x3cm made with 11 cuts inbetween to split it into 10 little rectangles. Seen below. </p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_0193.JPG" alt="" /></span><span class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_0195.JPG" alt="" /></span>
                            After the cut the inside was measured which turned out to be 100.14mm and then the length of the rectangles placed side by side which came out to 98.36mm. Subtracted and divided by 11 the lazer thickness came out to, as seen below, 0.16mm.

							Back to the model. Following the directions given to us by the teacher the kerf was set in Fusion 360 and an .svg file was exported onto a USB drive then moved into Inkscape on the computer connected to the lazercutter. The papersize was set to 500x500 and the corners were aligned and the lines and fills were set to the same as seen in the vinyl project.
							
							<p>Taking the 500x500 sheet to the printer it was set in the corner of it and the template, imported from Inkscape onto the program that runs the cutter, the corner of my model was aligned with the corner of the acrylic sheet.
                              <span class="image fit"><img src="images/settings.png" alt="" /></span>
                                
                            Now these settings worked perfectly. Except it needed to be cut twice. and the first time around the speed was set higher and with me rushing into things, I removed the sheet without checking if it cut all the way through. And I thought i could just punch it through but I ended up just completeley breaking the sheet and ruining the whole thing. As seen below:<span class="image fit"><img src="images/fail.png" alt="" /></span> the cuts were too tight on some areas, and in some others it didnt cut, not even halfway through. So another pass was made. after taking it all out the places where the fit was too tight the holed and edges were filed down a little just so itd fit well with a sqeeze. 
                            </p>
                            <p>After setting things up, correctly this time, and twice. All the parts were taken out and pieced together with the following being the final result.</p>
