                        </h1>
                            
                            <p>The goal of this project was to get us familiar with 3d printing.</p>
							<b> Part 1: test print</b>
					
                             <p> To get to grips with the printer being used and its progam that followed it was decided to do a all in one print test to check overhangs and tolerances that could get in the way for designing the final object to be printed.</p>
                              
                            <p>Looking one up this one was found and printed.<a href=" https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2656594/files "> All in one test </a> </p>
                            What i needed to see most was the ring sizes, for the axles and of course the overhang since it was a ring as well as the brigdging, most of the design was blocky and simple so much testing wasnt needed along with the excellent quality of the printer making it all simple and easy without me having to scrutinize the test that thoroughly.

                            Happy with the result the modeling work started.
                            <p>Having to design and print something that couldnt be made via additive or subtractive manufacturing i decided to make a jointed ring that would be printed in one go. With two joints that will go over the whole of your finger with its design being inspired by 80's mecha, Blade Runner, Gundam design queues</p>

                            <p>I started off mesasuring each joint of my finger and the length of each. Determining how long the distance between each joint should be.
                            </p>
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ring1.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>The first joint was measured and its diameter measured too, I designed each joint by itself these being the steps taken.</p>
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ring2.png" alt="" /></span>
                            
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ring3.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>Second joint now in place</p>
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ring4.png" alt="" /></span>
                            
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ring5.png" alt="" /></span>
                          
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/ringdesign.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>This being the final design. Hopefully I mangaed to capture the spirits of the mecha gundam design.</p>
                            <p>With the printer being a prusa mini,<a href=" https://www.prusa3d.com "> prusa slicer </a>, their proprietary 3d printig software was downloaded.</p>
                            With the setup being relatively simply I only needed to select wich printer I was using and the next thing i needed to was to import the model from Fusion 360 onto the slicer.
                            
                            
                        
                                
                              <span class="image fit"><img src="images/print%20setup.png" alt="" /></span>
                       <p>Setting to the infill to 60% and supports everywhere the G-code was exported to an sd car which was placed into the printer and from the printer screen it was selected and off it went.
                            </p>
 
							<p>With supports being everywhere, this was the result right out of the printer.</p>
                            
                             <span class="image fit"><img src="images/print69.png" alt="" /></span>
                            
                            <p>After heavy cleanup this was the final result:</p>
                            
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/no%20bend.png" alt="" /></span>

                            <p>Everything working as it should and bending the right way</p>
                            <p>The final goal was to paint the part in a white, red, yellow and blue paint scheme so it would look like a Gundam, but I threw it on the bed when dinner was ready and then sitting on it I ended up breaking it before I could paint it.</p>

					<b>Part 2: 3D Scanning</b>
							
                            <p>The next part of the assignment was to scan something.</p>
                            <p>Using the lidar sensor and cameras on my Iphone 12 Pro Max the app "Polycam" makes it sumer simple to 3d scan something. With questionable accuracy, I scanned my room with this being my final result.</p>
